# skunify

little helper at work (doesn't relly help, because it's not working)

this is my first python project and it doesn't work, because i could not get the api to work correctly. i guess it's more the json that doesn't fit the post request of the ecwid api. someday i will fix this, but right now i'm concentrating on automations that work and really help me at my desk in the office. 

it's also my first try uploading stuff to github. i still have to learn alot, so take it easy on me.

## what does it do?

ecwid api
- post a new product

## to do:

- mysql database with all the products
- php admin login for creating and deleting products in ecwid shop
